# MTRA's C++ Library

### Summary
- `mtra::vector` (no iterators yet)

- smart pointers (coming soon)

### Future Plans
- write full tests for `mtra::vector`

- write `mtra::spsc_queue_lockfree` and tests

- SIMD utilities will only work on architectures supporting AVX2

- FFTs and IFFTs (for audio programming)

- internal red-black-tree class
