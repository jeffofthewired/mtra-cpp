# MTRA's C++ Library

### Summary
- `mtra::vector` with forward & backward iterators

- a `type_traits` header

- `mtra::spsc_queue_lockfree` (no tests yet)

### Future Plans
- write test and benchmark for `mtra::vector`

- write test and benchmark for `mtra::spsc_queue_lockfree`

- functional programming library

- smart pointers (coming soon)

- SIMD utilities will only work on architectures supporting AVX2

- internal red-black-tree class
